# Typing Tutor

## Project Overview:
This project involves creating a typing game in MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) that incorporates Irvine library procedures and macros. Players will type falling words displayed on the terminal screen, enhancing their typing accuracy and speed while earning a score based on performance metrics like words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy.
